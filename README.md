# credit-risk-classification

In this analysis a machine learning model is created to evaluate the credit worthiness of borrowers. A dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company is used to build the model.

The machine learning model Logistic Regression is used to predict the loan status based on different features in the data.

# Python Libraries used:
  * Pandas
  * numpy
  * scikit-learn

# ML stages:

   * Preprocess: Reading the data from CSV, defining X and y variables and splitting it into subsets for training and testing the model.
   * ML model: Logistic Regression Modeling is used here as the outcomes are binary from data.
   * Train : A large subset of the labeled data is used to teach the model to recognize classification patterns.
   * Predict: Finally, the model is used to predict labels for unclassified data(test data).

 #Deliverables 
    * Jupyter notebook code - credit_risk_classification.ipynb
    * Credit risk analysis report : report-template.md
